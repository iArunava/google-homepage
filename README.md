# google-homepage

This project is an implementation of the Official Google Home Page. Though, it can be quite done if one pops open the dev-tools.
But, this was not the case for this project. The project was made in an effort to learn and get familiar with website development, mainly
the idea where, given a design (say, by a web designer) to convert it to a working website.

# Project From

The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

# How true was the developer of this project

The project was asked to be developed with a rule that said not to pop open the dev-tools.

### So was the dev-tools poped open ?

To be very truthful, the dev-tools was popped open only 2 times.
1) To get the link for the Google Image
2) To get the link for the favicon.ico
